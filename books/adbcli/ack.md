# Acknowledgments

The implementation of this ArtifactDB Command Line Interface is heavily based on the python-based generic client,
[artifactdb-client](https://github.com/artifactdb/artifactdb-client), developed and maintained by Max Hargreaves. It
provides low level access to common ArtifactDB REST API endpoints, authentication and all the "nitty-gritty" details
required to properly talk to such instances, the proper way.

Marek Brys proof-read this tutorial (thanks for the feedback) and contributed to the custom CA certificates
installation, you now know who to ask if still having issues :)
